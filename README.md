# Instagram Clone
Just a simple repo to clone some features of Instagram in iOS using Swift. This is no more than a Swift programming exercise to learn how to build scalable apps with great UI and UX using Firebase as backend.
This project is a long term project that will continue until nearly every feature on the real app is achieved. Added features will be updated on the Features section.

## The features are:
- UI with semblance with the Instagram app.
- Posting pictures from the picture gallery into the database (Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Storage).
